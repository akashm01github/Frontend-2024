Here are some tasks to help you practice various background properties in CSS:

### Task 1: Solid Background Color
- **Objective:** Create a `div` with a solid background color.
- **Instructions:**
  - Set the background color to `#3498db` (or any color of your choice).
  - Add some padding (e.g., 20px) inside the `div`.
  - Add a text like "Solid Background" inside the `div`.

### Task 2: Background Image with Color Overlay
- **Objective:** Add a background image with a semi-transparent color overlay.
- **Instructions:**
  - Set a background image of your choice inside a `div`.
  - Add a semi-transparent background color using `rgba()` (e.g., `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` for a dark overlay).
  - Use the `background-blend-mode: overlay;` property.

### Task 3: Background Positioning
- **Objective:** Position a background image at different locations.
- **Instructions:**
  - Add a background image to a `div`.
  - Use the `background-position` property to place the image at the center, top-right, and bottom-left positions.
  - Try different values like `center center`, `right top`, and `left bottom`.

### Task 4: Background Size
- **Objective:** Control the size of the background image.
- **Instructions:**
  - Add a background image to a `div`.
  - Use `background-size` with values like `cover`, `contain`, and specific sizes (e.g., `100px 50px`).
  - Observe how the image scales with different sizes.

### Task 5: Background Repeat
- **Objective:** Experiment with background repeat options.
- **Instructions:**
  - Add a small repeating background image (like a pattern).
  - Use `background-repeat` to repeat the image both horizontally and vertically, only horizontally, or not at all.
  - Try using `background-repeat: repeat-x`, `repeat-y`, and `no-repeat`.

### Task 6: Gradient Background
- **Objective:** Apply linear and radial gradients as background.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create a `div` with a linear gradient background using `background: linear-gradient()`.
  - Experiment with different color stops and directions (e.g., `to right`, `to bottom left`).
  - Create another `div` with a radial gradient background using `background: radial-gradient()`.

### Task 7: Fixed Background Image
- **Objective:** Make the background image stay fixed while scrolling.
- **Instructions:**
  - Set a large height for your `div` (e.g., `800px`) and add some scrollable content.
  - Add a background image to the `div` and use `background-attachment: fixed`.
  - Scroll through the content and observe the fixed background.
